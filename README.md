This project is based on analysis and classification of news using an LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) - Recurrent Neural Network to Identify fake news over a text-based news stream.

Developed using python, with spacy, and NLTK for Natural Language Processing and Tensorflow, pandas with WordCloud, Seaborn,and Plotty for visualizations.
The goal of this project is to detect fake news based on Recurrent Neural networks.
Natural language processors (NLP) work by converting words(text) into numbers.
These numbers are then used to train an AI/Ml models to make predictions.
AI/ML based fake news detector is crucial for companies and media to automtically predict whethe ciruclating news is fake or real.
Here we will analyze thousands of news text to detect if it is real or fake.
The NLP model will label the real news as 1 and fake news as 0.
